We propose to build a virtual doctor.. 
The primary capability of this doctor would be to predict the disease suffered by the user from the symptoms, past medical reports, past family reports  as reported by the user.. 

Our doctor would help suggest medicine to be taken for the respective disease,thereby giving directions to the nearest medical shop..

If need arises and the matter needs immediate medical attention ,it would help to contact a doctor by fixing an appointment for the user or would help the doctor to communicate with the patient on video call as the case may permit..

The decision to communicate with doctor on video call or to rush the patient to the doctor would be taken by the application itself.. 

We plan to deploy it through an Android Application..
